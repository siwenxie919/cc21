# Introduction to Topology Data Analysis

Yiwei Ren

For the Class Contribution, I made a YouTube video about Topology Data Analysis. In the 
video, I talked about basic elements of Topology Data Analysis as well as how this tool related 
to data visualization. This 10-minute talk will give you an overall idea about what Topology Data 
Analysis is.
